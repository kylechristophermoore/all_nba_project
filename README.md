# All NBA Prediction Project

Using the regular season statistics of NBA players from [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) to predict voting results for All NBA awards. All NBA awards are highly prestigious and directly impact how much money a player can earn, as well as the betting market surrounding awards. The data will labeled whether or not a player was All NBA. Modeling will be performed with various classification methods from pythonâ€™s sklearn: logistic regression, k nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and random forests. These will attempt to determine the best prediction accuracy as well as the most impactful statistics(feature selection) a player can have. Success will be determined with classification reports and mainly the F-Scores of each classification model, due to F-scores being one of the better assessors when using imbalanced data, such as 15 All NBA players vs ~500 total players per year.
